# RSS Parser Improvement Notes

## Summary of Changes

We've significantly improved the RSS feed handling to address issues with Meltwater and Nettavisen.no feeds:

1. **CDATA Handling Enhancement**:
   - Fixed issue with `]]>` in CDATA sections causing XML parsing errors
   - Added multiple approaches to handle malformed CDATA content
   - Implemented better text extraction that's robust against CDATA formatting issues

2. **Item Detection Improvements**:
   - Added support for multiple RSS item formats and selectors
   - Implemented a robust item detection algorithm that works across feed formats
   - Fixed issues where only one item would be detected in certain feeds

3. **Namespace Support**:
   - Added proper handling for namespaced tags (`media:`, `dc:`, etc.)
   - Automatically adds required namespace declarations when missing
   - Fixes broken namespaced tags that XML parsers might reject

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Added progressive fallbacks to handle problematic feeds
   - Improved error reporting for easier troubleshooting
   - Added debug mode accessible via URL parameter for feed diagnostics
   
5. **React Component Stability**:
   - Fixed React hook dependency issues causing error #310
   - Improved performance with proper useMemo/useCallback hook usage
   - Added safeguards against circular dependencies in hooks

## Implementation Notes

Key changes in our implementation:

1. The original feed parser was completely replaced with `ImprovedFeedParser`
2. XML preprocessing was enhanced to fix common XML errors
3. More robust tag detection handles a variety of feed formats
4. Added debug tools to help diagnose feed issues
5. Refactored React components to avoid hook dependency issues
6. Added CSS fallbacks to handle module typing issues

These changes maintain compatibility with all existing feed formats while adding support for more complex feeds like Meltwater without hardcoding URL-specific logic. We've also fixed critical React rendering issues that were causing the minified error #310.

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Access the web part with problematic feeds like Meltwater
2. Add `?rssDebug=true` to the URL to enable debugging if needed
3. Verify items and images are displayed correctly
