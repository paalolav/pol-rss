# RSS Parser Improvements - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the latest improvements made to the RSS Feed Parser to address issues with problematic feeds like Meltwater (403 errors) and Nettavisen (only showing one item).

## Latest Improvements (May 16, 2025)

### 1. Enhanced Meltwater Feed Support
- Added specialized handling for Meltwater feeds to address 403 errors
- Implemented a retry mechanism with multiple authentication approaches
- Added User-Agent rotation to overcome server restrictions
- Enhanced header handling for API key authentication

### 2. XML Declaration Handling
- Fixed issues with multiple XML declarations in feeds
- Properly handles XML declarations that are not at the start of the document
- Ensures only one XML declaration is present in the feed

### 3. Improved CDATA Handling
- Better detection and repair of unclosed CDATA sections
- Properly escapes `]]>` sequences inside CDATA to prevent premature closing
- Ensures description tags are wrapped in CDATA where needed

### 4. XML Structure Improvements
- More conservative approach to fixing XML structure
- Stopped aggressive tag fixing that was breaking RSS feeds
- Better namespace handling for various feed formats

### 5. Proxy Service Enhancements
- Improved proxy fallback strategy with better error handling
- Added cache-busting for retry attempts
- Enhanced authentication parameter extraction and handling
- Better SharePoint integration through HttpClient support

### 6. Testing Tools
- Added dedicated testing utilities in `feedTester.ts` and `testRunner.ts`
- These tools can be used to validate feeds before adding them to production
- Provides detailed diagnostic information about feed parsing

## Testing Your Feeds

### Using the Test Runner
To test a feed with the new parser:

1. Add your feed URL to the `FEEDS_TO_TEST` array in `testRunner.ts`
2. Build the project with `gulp build`
3. The test results will show if items are being parsed correctly

### Using Debug Mode
To debug feeds in the SharePoint web part:

1. Add `?rssDebug=true` to your SharePoint page URL
2. Open browser developer tools to see detailed feed parsing logs
3. A debug console will also appear on the page with feed information

### Testing Problematic Feeds
For feeds like Meltwater or Nettavisen:

1. Add the feed URL to your web part configuration
2. Enable debug mode to see detailed parsing information
3. Verify that multiple items are being displayed correctly
4. Check that images and descriptions are properly rendered

## Testing Meltwater Feeds
If you encounter 403 errors with Meltwater feeds:

1. Make sure the API key is included in the URL
2. The improved parser will automatically try multiple authentication methods
3. For persistent issues, try using a proxy server approach
4. Ensure your SharePoint environment has proper CORS settings

## Known Limitations

1. Some feeds with extremely non-standard formats may still require specific handling
2. Authentication tokens in feed URLs may expire and need to be refreshed
3. There are some remaining ESLint warnings (console statements) that could be addressed in a future update

## Next Steps

1. Test the improved parser with problematic feeds in production
2. Consider adding a way to save test results for comparison over time
3. If needed, address the remaining lint warnings

## Feedback

If you encounter any issues with specific feeds, please document:
1. The feed URL
2. Any error messages displayed
3. Expected vs. actual results

This will help us continue to improve the RSS parser's robustness.
