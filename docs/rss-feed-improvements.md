# RSS Feed Improvements

## Overview
This documentation covers the improvements made to the RSS feed web part to fix issues with various RSS feed formats, particularly the Meltwater feed (which had 403 errors) and Nettavisen feed (which only showed one item).

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Image Detection
- Improved support for namespace tags including `media:thumbnail`
- Added support for multiple image detection patterns
- Enhanced URL extraction from various attribute formats
- Improved handling for feeds with custom image formats
- Better fallback mechanisms when primary image sources are missing

### 2. XML Preprocessing
- Added namespace handling for common RSS namespaces
- Fixed improperly closed namespace tags
- Added missing namespace declarations when needed
- Improved general XML cleaning and error handling
- Added feed-specific preprocessing for known problematic feeds

### 3. Error Handling and Diagnostics
- Better error messages for failed feed loads
- Added debugging console for troubleshooting feed issues
- Created a test harness to validate feed parsing
- Improved error reporting with specific feed issues

### 4. Authentication Support
- Added support for authenticated feeds like Meltwater
- Improved handling of API keys and authorization tokens
- Enhanced proxy service to maintain authentication parameters

### 5. CORS Handling
- Implemented multiple proxy fallback options
- Added SharePoint HttpClient support for authenticated environments
- Enhanced error reporting for CORS-related issues

## Special Feed Handling

### Meltwater
- Added special authentication handling for Meltwater's API
- Implemented proper bearer token and API key handling
- Fixed 403 error issues when accessing Meltwater feeds

### Nettavisen
- Added special XML preprocessing for Nettavisen's feed format
- Fixed issues with unclosed tags in content
- Improved namespace handling for their specific XML format
- Resolved the issue where only one item was showing

## How to Debug Feed Issues

We've added a new debug mode that can be enabled by adding `?rssDebug=1` to your SharePoint page URL. This will:

1. Show a debug console with feed parsing information
2. Log detailed diagnostics to browser console
3. Show more verbose error messages

Additionally, a new test harness utility is available for programmatically testing feeds. See [RSS Feed Tester Documentation](./rss-feed-testing.md) for details.

## Remaining Considerations

- Some RSS feeds may still require custom handling as they emerge
- Authentication tokens in feed URLs may expire and need to be refreshed
- Extremely large feeds may benefit from pagination support in the future

## Architecture Changes

The following new components were added:

1. **RssSpecialFeedsHandler** - Manages special cases for problematic feeds
2. **RssDebugUtils** - Provides debugging utilities for RSS feeds
3. **ImprovedFeedParser** - Enhanced parser with better support for various feed formats

The existing ProxyService was also enhanced with better authentication handling and multiple fallback options.
