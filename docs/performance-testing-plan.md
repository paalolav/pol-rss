# RSS Web Part Performance Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a structured approach to test the performance improvements in the RSS web part. Use this plan to validate that all enhancements are functioning as expected.

## Pre-Deployment Testing

### 1. Local Development Testing

- [ ] Verify build completes without errors
- [ ] Confirm development server starts successfully 
- [ ] Check that worker loading doesn't produce console errors
- [ ] Test with simulated slow network conditions

### 2. Feature Validation

#### Caching Tests
- [ ] Load RSS feed and verify items display correctly
- [ ] Refresh page and confirm items load instantly from cache
- [ ] Modify cache expiration setting and verify refresh behavior
- [ ] Clear browser storage and verify fallback to network fetch

#### Web Worker Tests
- [ ] Use large RSS feeds (>100 items) to test parser performance
- [ ] Verify UI remains responsive during parsing
- [ ] Check network tab to confirm worker is loading
- [ ] Test fallback by temporarily disabling worker support

#### Page Visibility Tests
- [ ] Open web part, then switch to another tab
- [ ] Return to tab after refresh interval and verify behavior
- [ ] Use performance monitoring tools to verify reduced processing in background

## Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Production Environment

- [ ] Deploy to production SharePoint environment
- [ ] Test with actual production RSS feeds
- [ ] Verify performance with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Check SharePoint-specific compatibility issues

### 2. Performance Metrics

- [ ] Measure initial load time compared to previous version
- [ ] Record time to parse various feed sizes
- [ ] Measure memory usage during extended operation
- [ ] Test on different devices and browser combinations

## Edge Case Testing

- [ ] Test with very large feeds (1000+ items)
- [ ] Verify behavior when localStorage quota is exceeded
- [ ] Test with unreliable network connections
- [ ] Verify behavior when switching between multiple tabs with the web part

## User Acceptance Testing

- [ ] Gather feedback from content editors and regular users
- [ ] Have users rate perceived performance improvement
- [ ] Document any usability issues related to the performance changes
- [ ] Collect suggestions for further optimization

## Test Results Documentation

Use the following format to record test results:

```
Test: [Test Name]
Date: [Test Date]
Environment: [Environment Details]
Results: [Pass/Fail]
Notes: [Observations]
Performance Metrics: [Relevant Metrics]
```

Compile all test results in a final validation report before considering the implementation complete.
